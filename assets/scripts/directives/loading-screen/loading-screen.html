<!--
    BEGIN: App-Loading Screen.
    --
    Until the AngularJS application code is loaded and bootstrapped, this is just
    "static HTML." Meaning, the [class-based] directive, "mAppLoading", won't
    actually do anything until the application is initialized. As such, we'll give
    it just enough CSS to "fail open"; then, when the AngularJS app loads, the
    directive will run and we'll remove this loading screen.

    NOTES ON ANIMATION:

    When the AngularJS application is loaded and starts bootstrapping, all
    animations are disabled until all the routing information and templating
    information is loaded AND at least two digests have run (in order to prevent
    a flurry of animation activity). As such, we can't animate the root of the
    directive. Instead, we have to add "ngAnimateChildren" to the root element
    and then animate the inner container. The "ngAnimateChildren" directive allows
    us to override the animation-blocking within the bounds of our directive, which
    is fine since it only runs once.
-->
<div ng-animate-children>

    <!--
    HACKY CODE WARNING: I'm putting Style block inside directive so that it
    will be removed from the DOM when we remove the directive container.
